# resume

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **LuaTeX**, largely inspired from [Deedy-Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume).

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

This template attempts to **look clean**, highlight **details**, be a **single page**, and allow useful **LaTeX templating** as well as to be **machine readable**.

The goal was also to make a bi-lingual resume (en/fr) with as much code in the common class `resume-openfont.cls`.
